# ☁️ Cloud-Based E-Commerce Platform with Automated DevOps Pipeline

This project is a **microservices-based e-commerce application** deployed on **Azure** with a fully automated **DevOps pipeline**.  

It demonstrates my skills in **Terraform, Docker, CI/CD, monitoring, and cloud infrastructure**, and showcases my ability to **build and manage scalable cloud applications**.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a **robust, cloud-ready e-commerce platform** that:  
- Can handle increasing traffic with **containerized microservices**  
- Uses **infrastructure as code (Terraform)** for reproducible deployments  
- Has an automated **CI/CD pipeline** for faster and reliable releases  
- Provides **monitoring and logging** via Prometheus + Grafana  

This project mimics real-world cloud application scenarios and demonstrates **end-to-end DevOps implementation**.

## 🔹 Features Implemented

### ✅ Completed / Working

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform**  
  *Initial setup including provider configuration and basic Azure resources (Resource Group, VNet, Subnet)*  

- **Containerization**  
  *All services Dockerized with Docker Compose for easy deployment*  

- **CI/CD Pipeline**  
  *GitHub Actions configured for automated build, test, and deployment*  

- **Monitoring & Logging**  
  *Prometheus + Grafana dashboards to visualize metrics and logs in real-time*  

- **Screenshots Proof** *(see below)*  

---

## 📌 Work in Progress

- ⏳ Security enhancements (IAM, secrets management)  
- ⏳ Auto-scaling policies for high traffic  
- ⏳ Live deployment demo  

---

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

This project follows a **microservices-based architecture**:

- Each service is containerized and independently deployable  
- Services communicate over REST APIs  
- Terraform provisions the cloud infrastructure, and Docker + CI/CD handles deployment  
- Monitoring is centralized via Prometheus + Grafana
